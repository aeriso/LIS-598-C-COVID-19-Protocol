This project will collect data from multiple municipalities in an effort to compare Coronavirus response and help public health officers,
researchers, and analysts find trends and share information. 
The data are collected on multiple platforms such as Socrata and ArcGIS, have diverse metadata elements, are open-source, and downloadable.
Data should be updated frequently in accordance with a published schedule to ensure constancy and the recency of the data.

As a researcher or data analyst, I want curated data so that I can study coronavirus trends in multiple cities.

As a curious citizen, I want data that is easy to read, search, and sort in order to learn more about municipal Coronavirus trends.

As a data curator, I want a template of how to manage data from multiple cities.
