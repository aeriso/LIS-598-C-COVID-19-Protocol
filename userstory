This project will collect data from multiple municipalities in an effort to compare Coronavirus response and help public health officers,
researchers, and analysts find trends and share information. The data are collected on multiple platforms such as Socrata and ArcGIS and
have diverse metadata elements. We expect to standardize the data, making it easier to study and analyze.

The data should be open-source and downloadable, giving us the ability to standardize and create common metadata elements for clarity.
Data should be updated frequently in accordance with a published schedule to ensure constancy and the recency of the data.
