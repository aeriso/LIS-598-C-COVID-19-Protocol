# LIS 598 C COVID 19 Protocol
 Final protocol for LIS 598.
 Anna Riso and Caitlin Smith
 Coronavirus open data in different cities.
 Citizens interested in how their city generally handles open data to determine how trustworthy the coronavirus data is would be able to use our protocol to make that determination. Researchers looking to gather curated data about COVID-19 may also find this of interest.
 We will curate and study open data about COVID-19 from multiple municipalities. We want to see if current open data infrastructure affects the sharing and dissemination of public health information in cities. We are also curious if the software platforms cities use have any bearing on the status of their information, or if it is attached to the focus of cities on providing open data.
