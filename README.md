 Final protocol for LIS 598.

 Coronavirus open data in different cities.
	
 Citizens interested in how their city generally handles open data to determine how trustworthy the coronavirus data is would be able to use our protocol to make that determination. Researchers looking to gather curated data about COVID-19 may also find this of interest.
	
We will curate and study Covid/Coronavirus data from ten municipalities: Cinncinati, OH; Las Vegas, NV; Los Angeles, CA; Buffalo, NY; San Francisco, CA; Boulder County, CO; Ann Arbor, MI; Fayetteville, NC; Honolulu, HI; and Poquoson, VA. According to the U. S. City Open Data Census, these are the five highest ranked and five lowest ranked cities, respectively. We want to analyze how well the COVID-19 data each city follow the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) standards for open data, and make suggestions for further curation. Some factors we think may influence how well cities conform to the W3C standards are current open data infrastructure and the software platforms used.
